<!-- <p class="content_title">Stereotypes & Me  </p> -->

<p>   So this week we delved into reading about stereotypes & the stereotype threat. The stereotype threat <a href = "http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html"> "refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group." </a></p>

<p> The thing that most struck me about watching the videos on this topic was how the sense of threat developed in moments of frustration and anxiety. So for instance, one could be feeling fine and seemingly not at all concious of being the only representative of [insert here - gender group, racial group ...] in the room. But the moment one feels frustration and anxiety (e.g., getting stuck on an exam question) a sense of societal expectations  "I'm not meant to be here, I'm not good at this ..." can set in and create a downward spiral. </p>

<p> I certainly relate to having moments of feeling out of place, the only woman in the room, not 'meant to be there'. And today, as I embark on this new journey into the technical world of coding (which is so different to my previous experience) it is sobering and encouraging to think about stereotype threats. It is in the moments when my code won't compile or I'm pairing with someone that seems to be moving at lightspeed that my moments of anxiety and frustration can kick in. It is in those moments that I am going to try to remember one of my favorite Japanese quotes: Saru mo ki kara ochiru! "Even the monkey falls from the tree!"  </p>
