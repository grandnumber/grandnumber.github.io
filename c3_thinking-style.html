<p class="content_title">Stylish thinking & growing at DBC... </p>

<p>So, I am a visual thinker...and also a reading thinker. Essentially I learn best through alot of reading & great visuals - which means that in the world of high tech I still pull out a pencil and paper!  </p>

<p>I was unsurprised but encouraged by the findings of my Learning Style quiz - I always drew things when trying to explain my thinking &  now I had a reason to do it! During Phase 0 I have really tried to embrace this urge to use paper even when it feels 'wrong' given how much onscreen work we are doing. I have found that taking notes as I read & most importantly after I finish coding assignments has helped me to remember what I have learnt and put it in context. I have also gone super old school and printed out cheatsheets for sublime, git & the command line - something about seeing and touching it in front of me helps me remember. </p>

<!-- <p>I was really worried about putting down my visual preferences here - thinking that puts pressure on my blog layout  - "really? you think you're visual huh? well have you seen this website?!" which leads me to Fixed vs Growth mindsets ...</p> -->

<!-- <p>I was really </p> -->
