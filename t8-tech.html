<p class ="blog_date">24th January 2015</p>

<p>"TDD" as a term is something I have heard bandied about for a long time. Before I started learning to code my general reaction to hearing people talk of Test Driven Development in awe was "huh? so you didn't bother testing things before? "... Needless to say I have a greater appreciation for the power of TDD and why it isn't simply putting tests in where there were none before ;-)  </p>

<p> To be precise, TDD is: <a class = "quote" href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">"a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards. " </a>

  <span class = "new_line"> Which in simple terms means a 5 step process: </span>


<p class="content_title">1. Write Test:</p>

<p> Write a test for the smallest part of code that you need to write.  </p>


<p class="content_title">2. Run & Fail: </p>

<p> Run the test - it will fail.. given there is no code ;-)  </p>
<p class="content_title">3. Write Code: </p>
<p> Now, write code to pass the test. But focus on the minimum required to pass your test - no prizes for sophistication or extra functionality - just focus on passing the test! </p>


<p class="content_title">4. Run & Pass: </p>
<p> Now, run the test again - and make sure it passes! Don't write any new code or functionality until this first test passes. Once it passes - move on.. </p>
<p class="content_title">5. Refactor: </p>
<p> And refactor if necessary/appropriate at this time... then you get to </p>
<p class="content_title">6. Repeat: </p>
<p> For every portion of your code!!!  </p>
