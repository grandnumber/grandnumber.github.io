<p class="content_title">Net Neutrality at its simplest  </p>

<p>So, before starting to learn to code I had "net neutrality" referenced around the place and assumed (wrongly) that I sorta, maybe, kinda knew what it was about. I didn't. Net Neutrality in VERY simple terms is about ensuring that the traffic speed for accessing one kind of information on the net comes at the same speed as another. 'Net Neutrality' <a class = "quote" href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality"> is the principle that Internet service providers and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or mode of communication.  </a> </p>

<p> What does it really mean in practice? Well, at the moment traffic for any website (broadly speaking) will be provided to an end user at the same speed as any other. If you think of the web as a big highway then every car (website) can move along that highway at the same speed. However if we removed neutrality then companies (governments even) could pay an ISP additional money to ensure their website got a speeding permit and their website could be accessed faster than others. To be clear, internet speeds in rural areas are often slower than urban areas - that is not a net neutrality issue. (As long as the speed of access to all websites is equally slower in rural areas, that is an issue of infrastructure and access. ) </p>

<p> So, why would it matter if there was faster access for some? Well, proponents of net neutrality argue that it would entrench large incumbents and reduce competition (imagine if youtube could have 5x the access speed of any other video streaming service). Or, as has happened in the past: free peer-peer music sharing sites are slowed down while their paid competitors receive speedy access. But overall? Those in favour or net neutrality tend to argue on the grounds of ensuring: freedom of data, democratic communications, competition & innovation. On the other hand those against net neutrality tend to argue based on a belief in: less regulation generally, improving infrastructure & investment & preventing the overuse of bandwidth. </p>
