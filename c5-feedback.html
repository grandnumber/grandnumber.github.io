<p class="content_title">Pair Programming at DBC  </p>

<p>We have been pair programming now for over a month - at least twice a week - and giving & receiving formal feedback on each pair. Has it been good? yes. Has it been hard? yes, at times. Has it been useful? definitely.</p>

<p> I find that my nervousness is decreasing each time I pair- but there is always that feeling of "what if we don't get on?" "what if I can't keep up?" "what if they can't keep up?" ... I find that it almost always surprises me how much I can do in a pairing session and that is probably its biggest benefit for me at the moment. I have met some great people and have learnt to adapt to different styles of pairing. Sometimes when there is confusion it is so tempting to wish you were alone and could 'sort it out in private' and then come back - bullet proof. But as Brene Brown says that is a seductive way to take ourselves out of the game. So I am trying to remind myself to stay present, ask questions and talk through the difficult parts til we find the solution... so far seems to be working...</p>

<p> Feedback has been really helpful in helping me understand where to focus my efforts in subsequent pairing sesssions.  In DBC feedback follows the guidelines of Actionable, Specific, and Kind. As a result the feedback has been focused on alot of positive feedback and specific constructive feedback which is great. </p>
