<p> So I think we have all heard by now the oft repeated phrase "there are no stupid questions". Perhaps not - and I would always err on the side of asking questions rather than staying silent in ignorance. But are there ways to ask better questions? Can we think better of our questioning capacity - given how important asking for clarification is?  </p>



<p>For me, I think that the key is in contextualizing and phrasing questions clearly - for only then can you get a great answer. In the context of a classroom environment like DBC reminding myself of some question guidelines is helpful!  </p>


<p><ol>1. Steer clear of closed ended questions - if all you ask for and get is a Yes/No you are asking for basic confirmation or permission not gaining any insight and clarification or perspective.</ol> 
<ol>2. Set some basic context & be concise - "On slide 4 it said that volatility was increasing but the observation here is X - I am struggling to reconcile the two observations, can you help me?" vs "Is volatility big or small?" </ol> 
<ol>3. Ask follow-up questions or clarifying questions as your question is answered - focus on understanding what you need to.  </ol> 
<ol>4. Listen to the other Q&A around you - don't just wait for your question - it may be answered in the context of something else!  </ol> 

<p>So here's to 9 weeks of crazy learning & lots and lots of questions! </p>
