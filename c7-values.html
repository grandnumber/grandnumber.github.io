<!-- <p class="content_title">Finding Courage   </p> -->

<p> This week we are looking at our values, how we live up to them & how to affirm them. Courage is hard for me to describe, to define what I mean. Courage, for me, is a deep willingness to acknowledge my fear, face that fear and still take action no matter how frightened I find myself. It is not being acknowledged as fearless or brave or tough - it is not about being acknowledged. It is about finding the ability to listen to my own wishes and still follow them in spite of fear. Not the most eloquent description - perhaps others can better describe courage for me:</p>

<p class="quote"> “I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship.”
—Louisa May Alcott Novelist </p>

<p class="quote"> "He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life."
—Muhammad Ali </p>

<p class="quote">"You will never do anything in this world without courage. It is the greatest quality of the mind next to honor."
—Aristotle </p>


<p class="quote"> "Bravery is the capacity to perform properly even when scared half to death."
—Omar N. Bradley </p>

<p>So, if we accept that we have a common understanding of courage - how then to affirm it? The first step, for me, is reaffirming for myself that courage is not the absence of fear - it's ok to be frightened. After that it is allowing myself to feel that fear - not just accept it at an intellectual level. And that is the hardest part for me - truly feeling fear. I find that once I allow myself to be in the fear I can take action, I can embody courage. So finding the fear, naming it and most importantly, feeling it - is critical. Perhaps I can best affirm this, and convey my thinking in the words of another - John Wayne put it so well:

"Courage is being scared to death -- and saddling up anyway" </p>

<p> So, here is to truly thinking and feeling before and during DBC - and saddling up anyway! </p>
