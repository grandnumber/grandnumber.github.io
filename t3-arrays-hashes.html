<p class ="blog_date">5th December 2014</p>

<p>So we have been playing in the early days of Arrays & Hashes this week. I struggle to come up with pithy titles and puns for these data structures - but you know what? They're actually pretty cool - throw in Ruby enumerable methods and they rock! </p>

<p class="content_title">1. Arrays keep your life orderly and prioritised - just how you like it!: </p>

<p> To be precise: <a class = "quote" href ="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_arrays.htm">"Ruby arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. Each element in an array is associated with and referred to by an index." </a>
  <span class = "new_line"> Which in simple terms means that data (integers, strings, other arrays/hashes!) stored in an array is kept in numerical order - item one is at index 0, item two at index 1, item three at index 2 ...  </span>
The really helpful thing about this is that we can therefore access any item within the array by simply referencing it's index number. It makes finding data within the array simple.  </p>

<!-- <p>Let's take an array which keeps track of the fruit on our shopping list - ["bananas", "dates", "</p> -->

<p class="content_title">2. Hashes keep a tonne of info handy and accessible with easy retrieval: </p>

<p> A Hash on the other hand is <a class = "quote" href = "http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_hashes.htm"> a collection of key-value pairs like this: "employee" => "salary". It is similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index.</a>  </p>

<p> While the lack of an ordered index means we can't simply go and find the data at index 3, we can find the data using its "key". For instance, we could create a hash to store all the information we need to know about a contact in our address book using key value pairs:

<span class = "new_line"> {  Name (key) => John Smith (value) </span>
<span class = "new_line"> Phone (key) => 222-222-2222 (value) </span>
<span class = "new_line"> Email (key) => John@Smith.com (value) </span>
<span class = "new_line"> Address (key) => #22 Smith Street (value)   }</span>

<sp

 </p>

<p class="content_title">3. Ruby Enumerables just ROCK: </p>

<p> Ruby has a large number of Enumerable Methods laid out at Ruby Docs which make  traversing, searching, sortomg and manipulating arrays & hashes (almost) easy. Rather than writing long loops & complicated code the enumerable methods provide ready-built-in methods to do many of the things you will want to do with your arrays & hashes. <a href = "http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.5/Enumerable.html "> Like sorting, flattening, counting, mapping and all sorts!  </p>
