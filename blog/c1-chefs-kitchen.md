Feet to the fire

starting DBC ...

21st November 2014

My sense of DBC thus far & after the fireside chat ...
Drinking from the fire hydrant - feeling overwhelmed and a little behind most of the time & being ok with that! The curriculum as well as the immersiveness of the experience seem to combine to make it all encompassing... that hasn't changed my expectations of DBC. I do love how collaborative the approach is - everyone in the kitchen together.

However at this point I think my expectations of myself have changed a little. I was waiting for the moment things would sink in, that they would "click" and I think that I need to think of it more as a ride. I am up for the ride - I don't control it, only make some small corrections from time to time and stay safe! I am excited to start the ride and see where it takes me!
