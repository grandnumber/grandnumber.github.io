<p> Ahhh - conflict! Having been brought up in an English/Scottish home conflict is something that was rarely expressed openly. (The WORST thing was being sent to "coventry" - not being spoken to at all for a period of time!). So it took me a while to learn about expressing and dealing with conflict in the open. Something of an  ongoing life journey, like many things! So why is dealing with conflict so critical? </p>

<p class="quote"> “10% of conflict is due to difference in opinion and 90% is due to the wrong tone of voice"
—Anonymous, often attributed </p>
<p> Well, once a conflict occurs it is usually accompanied by anger and frustration... which can lead to raised voices and harsh words (or a withdrawl in a more passive expression). Which is why we need to recognise conflict and allow ourselves to acknowledge it before we lash out and compound the situation.</p>

<p class="quote"> "All conflict we experience in the world, is a conflict within our own selves."
—Brenda Shoshanna</p>

<p>And as I look inward, usually when there is conflict, there really is some form of conflict within. Did I have expectations that were unreasonable in this situation? Perhaps I was expecting too much? Or just expecting something from the wrong person. Or am I being stubborn about a point of view because I am afraid of trying things a different way? As the quote above points out - conflict occurs outwardly with other people, but also within ourselves.</p>

<p class="quote">"Peace is not the absence of conflict, but the ability to cope with it."
—Dorothy Thomas </p>

<p>So, if we can learn to recognise, acknowlege and really stop to look inward can we avoid conflict? No. And in many ways we don't want to - but I believe that we can find healthier and less painful ways to try and cope with the conflict. Perhaps talking about the situation or perhaps removing ourselves from the situation for a time. And if it really is a conflict that cannot be resolved - then walking away and learning from it, so that it hopefully does not occur again in the future.  </p>
